# TrafficMonitor
An experimental view of network data
Most network monitoring tools show a line or bar graph of data. In addition the data does not show the history of data. This is a different view of how network traffic can be viewed using colors and a timeline independent of each source. Here is what you would see after running the tool for a full day on my laptop.
